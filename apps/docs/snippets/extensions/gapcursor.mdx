Enables cursor placement at normally unreachable positions.

Shows a horizontal line cursor before/after tables, images, and other block elements where text cursors can't normally go.

import { SuperDocEditor } from '/snippets/components/superdoc-editor.jsx'

<SuperDocEditor
  html={`
    <p>Use arrow keys to navigate around this table:</p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <td>Cell 1</td>
        <td>Cell 2</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Cell 3</td>
        <td>Cell 4</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>When you reach the edge of the table, the gap cursor appears as a horizontal line, allowing you to add content before or after the table.</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>Gap cursors also appear around other block elements like horizontal rules (above) or images where normal text selection isn't possible.</p>
  `}

<Note>
**How to see it:** Use arrow keys to navigate to the edges of tables or around block elements. The gap cursor appears as a thin horizontal line where normal cursors can't go.
</Note>

## When gap cursor appears

The gap cursor activates at positions that are:
- **Before/after tables** - Add content outside table boundaries
- **Around images** - Insert text before or after inline images
- **Near horizontal rules** - Place cursor at hard-to-reach positions
- **Between void blocks** - Navigate between non-editable elements
- **Document boundaries** - Start/end of document near block elements

## Visual appearance

```
Normal cursor (vertical):      Gap cursor (horizontal):
                              
    Text here|                 ━━━━━━━━━━━━
                               [Table here]
    More text                  ━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

## Use case

- **Table Navigation** - Add content before/after tables without complex workarounds
- **Image Positioning** - Insert text around images and media
- **Better UX** - Eliminate "stuck cursor" frustrations
- **Document Structure** - Navigate complex layouts with nested blocks
- **Accessibility** - Keyboard-only users can reach all document positions
