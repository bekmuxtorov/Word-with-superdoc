    <p>The editor is where your ideas take shape.</p>
    <p>You can type freely, format your text, and structure content the way you need.</p>
    <p>But once the document grows larger, it becomes harder to find what you are looking for.  </p>
    <p>That is where the search feature helps.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>With search, you can jump directly to a word or phrase without scrolling line by line.  </p>
    <p>Imagine you are reviewing a long draft and want to find every place the word "editor" appears. </p>
    <p>Instead of scanning manually, the search function highlights each match.  </p>
    <p>From there, you can quickly navigate through results or replace the text with a new term.  </p>
    <br/>
    <p>This makes editing faster and more reliable.  </p>
    <p>Writers use search to replace names across a story.  </p>
    <p>Developers use search to verify that a technical term is consistent.  </p>
    <p>All of these tasks become easier when the editor supports search and replace.  </p>
