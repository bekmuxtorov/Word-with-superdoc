The eSign component wraps SuperDoc to provide a complete document acceptance workflow with audit trails, field management, and signature capture.

## What it does

- **Document display** - Shows the document source in the SuperDoc viewer
- **Requirement tracking** - Monitors scroll and required signer fields
- **Field management** - Populates document placeholders and collects signer input
- **Audit trail** - Records all interactions for compliance
- **UI agnostic** - Bring your own buttons and components

## Common use cases

### Terms of service

Track that users scrolled through and accepted your terms.

### Employment agreements

Capture signatures on offer letters with personalized fields.

### Consent forms

Manage multiple checkboxes for GDPR, medical, or marketing consent.

### Embedded workflows

Add document signing to larger forms like onboarding flows.

## How it works

```jsx
<SuperDocESign
  eventId="session-123"
  document={{
    source: "agreement.docx",
    validation: { scroll: { required: true } },
  }}
  fields={{
    document: [{ id: "1", value: "Acme Corp" }],
    signer: [{ id: "1", type: "signature", label: "Your Signature" }],
  }}
  onSubmit={async (data) => {
    // data includes audit trail, field values, timestamps
    await api.saveSignature(data);
  }}
/>
```

## Key concepts

**Document fields** - Values injected into the document (like mail merge)

**Signer fields** - Interactive elements the user completes (signature, checkboxes)

**Audit trail** - Timestamped log of all user actions

**Progressive enhancement** - Start simple, add customization as needed
