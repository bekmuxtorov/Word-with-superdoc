Your users need real Word documents. Not "Word-like." Not "compatible." Actual `.docx` files with tracked changes, complex tables, and section breaks that open perfectly in Microsoft Word.

## What SuperDoc does

A JavaScript library that renders and edits Word documents in the browser. Comments, tracked changes, complex tables, headers/footers, real-time collaboration — every feature users actually rely on. Built for advanced documents like legal contracts and enterprise workflows.

## Why it works

- **Real DOCX, not rich text** — This isn't another contenteditable wrapper. SuperDoc handles actual `.docx` files with their full complexity.
- **Any framework** — React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, vanilla JS. One component, zero lock-in.
- **Frontend and backend** — Runs in the browser or headless in Node.js for AI agents and automation.
- **Extensible** — Custom plugins, commands, nodes, and UI. Full ProseMirror access when you need it.
- **Dual licensed** — AGPLv3 for community use, Commercial License for enterprise.
