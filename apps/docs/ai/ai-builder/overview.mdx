<Note>
**Coming Soon** - AI Builder is currently in development. Use [AI Actions](/ai/ai-actions/overview) for ready-to-use AI operations.

AI Builder provides low-level primitives for building custom AI workflows with SuperDoc. Create your own AI agents, specialized document intelligence features, and proprietary automation logic.

## AI Actions is available now

While AI Builder is in development, you can use [AI Actions](/ai/ai-actions/overview) for:

- Find, replace, highlight operations
- Tracked changes and comments
- Document summaries and content generation
- Multi-provider support (OpenAI, Anthropic, custom)

See the [AI Actions Quick Start](/ai/ai-actions/overview#quick-start) to get started in minutes.
