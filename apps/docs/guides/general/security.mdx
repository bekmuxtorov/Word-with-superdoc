##

### SOC 2 report
An independent auditor maintains the SOC 2 report, certifying controls that protect your data.

The report follows Trust Services Criteria from the AICPA's Assurance Services Executive Committee (ASEC). It evaluates the design and effectiveness of controls for security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy.

### Continuous control monitoring
Drata's automation platform monitors 100+ security and privacy controls continuously, including GDPR compliance. Automated alerts and evidence collection verify compliance posture on any given day.

### Team access & trainings
All employees use 2-factor authentication, have role-based access restrictions, and sign a Non-Disclosure and Confidentiality Agreement. The team completes annual security training.

### Penetration tests
SuperDoc works with industry leading security firms to perform annual network and application layer penetration tests.

### Secure software development
Manual and automated security checks run throughout the software development lifecycle.

### Data encryption
Data is encrypted both in-transit using Transport Layer Security (TLS details) and at rest with AES256 (details).

### Infrastructure
All infrastructure runs on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). No physical servers, routers, or load balancers. Production data storage uses Google Spanner and Google Cloud Storage. GCP provides built-in security, compliance, and auditing.

### Multi-region data storage and automated backups
Cloud data is multi-region within the United States. Automatic backups replicate across multiple US data center locations.

### Compliance, audit logs, and monitoring
Third-party monitoring software detects potential attacks and anomalous network behavior. Every user action is logged and fully auditable. GCP systems are regularly audited for ongoing security and compliance (e.g., SOC 2).

### Terms of service and privacy policy
